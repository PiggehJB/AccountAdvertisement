# AccountAdvertisement
Use a token of a discord account to send a specified message in all of the account's servers.

Please note, if you do not know how to set it up (Just fill in your message in the `send_message` variable and run the script) I will not help you configure it. Please stop asking.
Also, I do not condone any illegal use of this that violates Discord's ToS in any way. This is strictly for educational purposes only! I am also not responsible for anything that happens while using the script.
